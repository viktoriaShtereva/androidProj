Official timekeeper of the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique since 2002, Chopard has created the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique Power Control in titanium and steel. Inspired by the classic single-seaters from the 1970s, the snailed grey dial and the yellow racing ring evoke speed while the stainless steel bezel and case back, stamped with the logo of the Monaco Automobile Club, add a touch of contrast to the titanium case. A timepiece at once technical and streamlined, beating with a movement that is chronometer-certified by the COSC.
