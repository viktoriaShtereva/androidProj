This stunning timepiece was created to mark the 40th anniversary of the Happy Diamonds collection, originally inspired by the myriad sparkling droplets of a waterfall. The 36 mm, 18-carat white gold case, diamond-set bezel, satin strap, cloud-like white mother-of-pearl dial and dancing prong-set diamonds all combine to evoke a soft, otherworldly landscape where dreams shift, shimmer and swirl in the light.
