The new Happy Diamonds line lifts Chopard's iconic moving diamonds heavenwards on a reverie-inspired journey full of light and joyful promise. This elegant pendant features four diamond-set 18-carat white gold circles of varying sizes that appear irregularly superimposed to resemble a cloud suspended delicately in the sky. The leading circle creates a dazzling frame for three diamonds that pirouette with unfettered imagination between sapphire crystals.
