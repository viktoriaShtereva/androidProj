Power, resistance and aesthetics come together in the Mille Miglia GTS Power Control, a resolutely masculine timepiece bearing all the hallmarks of Chopard expertise. Housing the self-winding Chopard Calibre 01.08-C and beating at a frequency of 28,800 v.p.h, this stainless steel watch on a rubber strap features an emblematic black dial with a power-reserve indicator at 9 o'clock. Chronometer certified by the COSC, the movement is equipped with a stop-seconds function allowing precise adjustments. Water-resistant to 100 metres, the 43mm case is equipped with an anti-reflective, scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. The movement, driven by a tunsten oscillating weight, can be admired through the sapphire crystal case back.
